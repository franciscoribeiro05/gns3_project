# 🎓 Final Project – Communications Networks I  
📍 **University of Aveiro**  
🏆 **Grade: 19.9/20** 

This project involved designing and deploying a full enterprise network using Cisco devices in GNS3, with detailed IP addressing (IPv4/IPv6), VLAN segmentation, DHCP, and NAT/PAT configuration for secure Internet access. On the application side, I developed a socket-based client/server game in Python and deployed web servers on VMs to host company-specific websites — integrating networking with real-world service simulation.
